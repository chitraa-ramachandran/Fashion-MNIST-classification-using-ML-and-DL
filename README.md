# Fashion-MNIST-classification-using-ML-and-DL  

This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating predominent machine learning algoriths and Custom CNN based deep learning algorithms we built to classify images for the Fashion MNIST dataset. It is a dataset of Zalando's article images â€” consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The dataset serves as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.  
  
## Objective
Analyse the performance of Fashion MNIST classification using classical machine learning algorithms and CNN based deep learning algorithms.  

## Classification using ML algorithms
In this part, we have experimented with the Fashion-MNIST dataset using various Machine
Learning algorithms/models. The objective is to identify (predict) different fashion products
from the given images using various best possible **Machine Learning Models** and compare their
results (performance measures/scores) to arrive at the best ML model. We have also performed
**Feature extraction** and **Dimensionality reduction** in these experiments.
